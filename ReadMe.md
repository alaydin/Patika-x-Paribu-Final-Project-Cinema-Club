## What is it about?

This is a final project for a Solidity course.

The project is a blockchain implementation of Cinema operations.

I was inspired by [Paribu-Cineverse](https://www.paribucineverse.com/cgv-moviepass).

The idea is to create a cinema club membership where users can exchange digital fiat currency for club's token, and enjoy discounts.

The logic contains two parts: User side and management side implementations.

More will be added before Jan 22. For now, you can read the contracts which are commented for both developers and non-developers.
