## What is it about?

This is a final project for a Solidity course. You can find a video demo of it [here](https://loom.com/share/7536029e5c464545a266d01af56b4e33)

The project is a blockchain implementation of Cinema operations.

I was inspired by [Paribu-Cineverse](https://www.paribucineverse.com/cgv-moviepass).

The idea is to create a cinema club membership where users can exchange digital fiat currency for club's token, and enjoy discounts.

The logic contains two parts: User side and management side implementations.

More will be added soon. For now, you can read the contracts which are commented for both developers and non-developers.
